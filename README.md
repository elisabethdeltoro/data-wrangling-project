## Python Data Wrangling
I used Python for this demo data wrangling task, aggregating excel files into one larger csv and checking for duplicate values, printing a notice if there are none or returning duplicates should they exist. For this exercise, I used **[this dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/jobs-dataset-from-glassdoor)** comparing salaries from Glassdoor reports.
