## Take Home Assessment: Section 1, Task 1
I used Python for the data wrangling task, creating new csv files to aggregate the provided **[Special Generals data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-97zfoX41pnDtMDe0ukQBa-MhCSPtERS)** and **[Special Primaries data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IpYZsHWJg5aCxouzJdugenKNUBqKLLib)**. The code provided then searches for duplicates in the first VOTER ID column, providing duplicates if there are any or a message if there are not.

I've included output files for convenience as well.

Thanks for your consideration!
Elisabeth
